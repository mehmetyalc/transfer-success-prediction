## Feature Engineering Impact

### Original Baseline Features (69 features)

The baseline dataset included:
- Performance metrics (goals, assists, minutes)
- Player attributes (age, position)
- Transfer details (fee, league transitions)
- Basic engineered features

### Expanded Dataset Features (33 optimized features)

Through comprehensive feature engineering, we created:

1. **Performance Metrics (6 features)**
   - `goals_per_90_before`, `assists_per_90_before`
   - `goal_contribution_before`
   - `perf_before_goals`, `perf_before_assists`, `perf_before_minutes`

2. **Player Attributes (8 features)**
   - Age categories: `is_young`, `is_prime`, `is_veteran`
   - Position indicators: `is_forward`, `is_midfielder`, `is_defender`, `is_goalkeeper`
   - Raw `age`

3. **Transfer Context (3 features)**
   - `fee_millions`, `fee_log`, `has_fee`

4. **Comparative Metrics (4 features)**
   - `goals_vs_league_avg`, `assists_vs_league_avg`
   - `goals_vs_position_avg`, `assists_vs_position_avg`

5. **Performance Changes (6 features)**
   - `goals_change`, `assists_change`, `goal_contribution_change`
   - `minutes_change`, `minutes_per_match_before`, `minutes_per_match_after`

6. **League Indicators (6 features)**
   - One-hot encoded league dummies for Big 5 leagues

### Why Fewer Features Performed Better

1. **Reduced Noise:** Eliminated redundant and weakly predictive features
2. **Better Generalization:** Less overfitting to training data patterns
3. **Stronger Signal:** Focused on features with proven predictive power
4. **Computational Efficiency:** Faster training and inference

- **Performance deltas** (before/after changes) highlighted improvement patterns
- **Logarithmic transformations** (fee_log) handled skewed distributions
- **Categorical encoding** (age groups, positions) improved interpretability

### 3. Model Architecture

- **Gradient boosting methods** (XGBoost, LightGBM) excelled with engineered features
- **Ensemble methods** (Voting) combined strengths of multiple models
- **Hyperparameter tuning** optimized for larger dataset

### 4. Robust Evaluation

- **Larger test set** (297 vs 165 samples) provided more reliable performance estimates
- **Consistent train-test split** (80/20) ensured fair comparison
- **Multiple metrics** (F1, AUC, RMSE, R²) gave comprehensive view
