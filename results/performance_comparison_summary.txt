MODEL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: 821 vs 1,483 Records
================================================================================

Dataset Size:
  Baseline: 821 records
  Expanded: 1483 records
  Increase: +662 records

Average Performance Changes:
  Classification F1:  -0.3800
  Classification AUC: -0.2236
  Regression RMSE:    +1.7062
  Regression R²:      -0.6940

Key Insights:
  ❌ Classification models showed significant F1-score degradation with expanded data
  ❌ ROC-AUC scores decreased, indicating worse class separation
  ❌ Regression models showed significant R² degradation
  ❌ Prediction errors (RMSE) increased significantly

Recommendations:
  1. Investigate why feature count dropped from 69 to 21 in expanded dataset
  2. Perform feature engineering to restore important predictive features
  3. Conduct hyperparameter tuning specifically for the expanded dataset
  4. Analyze 2023 transfer data characteristics vs 2020-2022 data
  5. Consider ensemble methods that may better handle the expanded data
  6. Evaluate if certain subsets (e.g., by league or position) show different trends
  7. Implement cross-validation to get more stable performance estimates
